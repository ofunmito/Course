**Why does this course use PostgreSQL and not MongoDB or MySQL?**

Most apps are not high scale as Twitter or Facebook and SQL Databases are used for 99.99% of those use cases. PostgreSQL does JSON storage (like MongoDB) and gives you all the best features of SQL (like relations, joins and more). It's the best of both worlds.
