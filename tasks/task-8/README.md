## Tasks

#### Step 1: Create an Add website form.

- Create an Add Webiste form that takes in the name and url and submit it to the api. 
- Make sure you have actions and reducers for: 
  - addWebsiteRequest - Use this action when you initiate the request. You would ideally show the loading indicator in the UI 
  - addWebsiteSuccess - Use this action when the request is successfully completed. Add this website to the list (look for Step 2)
  - addWebsiteFailed - Use this action when the request failed. Show the error in the UI.
  - addWebsiteReset - Make the add website state to initial state. 

#### Step 2: Create a Website List

- List websites saved into the DB. Make sure you create and use four actions and reducers (i.e - Request, Success, Failed and Reset) like you've made in step 1.

#### Step 3: Create a logout feature. 

- Implement the log out feature. When this is clicked. Clear sessions and local storage, and navigate to sign in.

- Push all the changes to your GitHub. 
- Make a screencast that shows all of this functionality to your mentor. You can use any free screencast tool.
