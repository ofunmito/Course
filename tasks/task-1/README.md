## Tasks


#### Step 1: Create a new NodeJS Project with Express. 

- Create a `git` repo on your GitHub account. 
- Create a simple NodeJS project. 
- Install `express` with NPM.
- Run the project, and make sure everything looks okay. 
- If you have questions on any of these steps. Please google them out. 


#### Step 2: Your First API. 

Today, you'll be creating your first GET and POST API's. If you don't know what they are. Please checkout [this video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UObINRj2EGY). 

 - Create a GET API. This is a very simple API and returns `{status: success}` as response. 
 
 ```
 Request Type: GET
 Route: /
 Response: {status: success}
 ```

 - Create a POST API. POST API's are used to save data on the server. Take a request payload `{data: 'Any String'}`. Create a variable that's ourside API scope and saev the data there, once you're done doing that return the same data in the request.  
 
 ```
 Request Type: POST
 Route: /data
 Request: {data: 'Any String'}
 Response: {data: 'Any String'}
 ```


 - Create a GET API. This GET API will be used to get the data that you've saved before with POST. 
 
 ```
 Request Type: GET
 Route: /data
 Response: {data: 'Any String'}
 ```
 
 There are a lot of reousrces on Google on how to build API's with express. Please google these resources if you're stuck. 
 
 
 #### Step 3: Push your changes to Git
 
 Push all your changes to your GitHub Repo. 

## Deliverable

Please submit your GitHub Repo to your mentor as soon as you're done, so he or she can review.
