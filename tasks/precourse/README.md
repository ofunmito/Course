## Environment Setup

- Use an Ubuntu machine. That's the best flavor of linux out there. We embrace open source and run open source in production, so its best to have your dev environment identical to production. If you're using Windows - switch to Ubuntu. MacOS is occasionally okay since its POSIX. We DON'T recommend using one because its overpriced and gives you exactly the same functionality an Ubuntu machine would give you with third the cost. 
- Install NodeJS, NPM, Docker, PostgreSQL. 
- We use Visual Studio Code as our primary IDE. It's excellent and simple - yet feature rich. This is the same IDE majority of JavaScript developers use. If you don't have that on your machine. Please install it. 
- IMPORTANT: Learning about debuging in VS Code is important. It'll save you days of your life (trust us!). [Please check this short 8 min video out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oFKNL7vYV8)
- IMPORTANT: [Please check this short video on Debugging in Chrome](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0XScE08hy8). It's worth watching. 
- Use Chrome as primary browser. It makes devs lives simpler. 
- [Add React Dev Tools to Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en)
- [Add ColorZilla to Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/colorzilla/bhlhnicpbhignbdhedgjhgdocnmhomnp?hl=en)
- If you need icons, svg, png's for your project - [FlatIcon](https://www.flaticon.com/) is the best reesource out there. 
- If you're looking for color matching , color combinations. Please check [Color Wheel by Adobe](https://color.adobe.com/)
- If you're looking for design inspiration. Please check [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/)
