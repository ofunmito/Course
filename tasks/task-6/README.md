## Important

Please use the same Git Repo for all the tasks. 

## Tasks

#### Step 1: Adding a website to the database

- Create a POST API which takes in name and URL, saves data in the Website table in the database. Returns the complete object with ID `{id: <id>, name: <name>, url: <URL>, userId: <userId>}` as response.

```
Request Type: POST
Route: /website/add
Request Body: `{name: <name>, url: <URL>}`
Response Code: 200 
Response Body: `{id: <id>, name: <name>, url: <URL>, userId: <userId>}`
```

- Before you save data. Please check if the user is authenticated and is valid. 
- Please note user id is not passed from the frontend. You need to decrypt UserID from the session token. 
- You cannot add the website with the same name or the same URL. If that's the case - return 400 which means Bad Request as status code.  
- You cannot access the API without the session. If you're not logged in and you're trying to access the API. Return 401 which means Unauthorised as status code.
- Make sure default status is `Online`
 

#### Step 2: List Websites 

- Create a GET API which returns a list of websites previously saved in the DB. Returns the an array of complete object with ID `[{id: <id>, name: <name>, url: <URL>, userId: <userId>}, {... ..}]` as response.

```
Request Type: GET
Route: /website/list
Response Code: 200 
Response Body: `[{id: <id>, name: <name>, url: <URL>, userId: <userId>}, {... ..}]`
```

- Before you serve the list. Please check if the user is authenticated and is valid. 
- Please note user id is not passed from the frontend. You need to decrypt UserID from the session token. 
- If you have an empty list. Return 200 with an empty array. 
- If the user is not logged in. Return 401.

## Deliverable

Push all your changes to your GitHub Repo. Please submit your GitHub Repo to your mentor as soon as you're done, so he or she can review.
