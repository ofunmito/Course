# App we're building

We're working on a server monitoring software. To check a production example - Please check out Fyipe.com.

**The app will:**

- Let users sign up and login.
- When the user logs in - he is navigated to dashboard.
- User can add one or more websites to monitor.
- The app will check the website every minute and will let the user know when it's down.
- The user will be alerted via email, call, SMS.
- User can also attach his twitter account and the updates about the website will be posted there.
- Dashobard will show the uptime percent from the day the `websites to monitor` were added and will also show the current status of the website - If its `Online` or `Offline`

### Why server monitoring?

It covers most concepts to build an app - from relationships in the database, to workers, to third party API integration and more. You can finish the app fairly quickly and get a good understanding of all the concepts from `Web Development`
